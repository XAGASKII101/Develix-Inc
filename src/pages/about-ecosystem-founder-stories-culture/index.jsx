      bio: `Born in Lagos and raised in Abuja, Alexius discovered his passion for technology while helping his grandmother's small business go digital in 2018. After studying Computer Science at the University of Lagos and working with fintech startups across West Africa, he realized that most advanced technologies weren't reaching the people who needed them most. This insight led to the founding of Develix with a mission to make AI and blockchain accessible to everyone, from Lagos street vendors to London enterprises.`,
